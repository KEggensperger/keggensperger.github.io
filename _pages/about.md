I am an Early Career Research Group Leader [AutoML for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/automl-for-science/) in the Cluster of 
Excellence [Machine Learning for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/) at 
the University of Tübingen.

**Short Bio** 

My research focuses on methods for *automated machine learning (AutoML)*, *hyperparameter optimization (HPO)*, and *efficient 
benchmarking*. Motivated by the goal of further democratizing the application of machine learning for scientific researchers 
and practitioners, I research how to improve and extend AutoML systems to leverage the full potential of ML for new applications.

Previously, I was part of the [ML Lab](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) at the University of Freiburg, where 
I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Frank Hutter](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/profile/hutter/) 
and [Marius Lindauer](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/de/institut/team/lindauer) (2022). I also co-developed several 
open-source tools for HPO methods and AutoML systems and have been a member of the team winning three AutoML 
competitions (2016, 2018, 2020). I am a junior head of the [Automl.org](automl.org) group, member of the [COSEAL](https://www.coseal.net/) group and a faculty member of [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/). 
Furthermore, I co-organized the AutoML workshop series at ICML in [2019](https://sites.google.com/view/automl2019icml/), [2020](https://sites.google.com/view/automl2020/home) 
and [2021](https://sites.google.com/view/automl2021) and served as a social chair (2022,2023) and as a program chair (2024) for the [AutoML Conference](www.automl.cc).
