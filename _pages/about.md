**Short Bio.** I am an Early Career Research Group Leader [AutoML for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/automl-for-science/) in the Cluster of Excellence [Machine Learning for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/) at the University of Tübingen. From October 2025, I will start as a professor for ML and AI at the [TU Dortmund University](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) and the [Lamarr Institute](https://lamarr-institute.org/).

Previously, I was part of the [ML Lab](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) at the University of Freiburg, where I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Frank Hutter](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/profile/hutter/) and [Marius Lindauer](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/de/institut/team/lindauer) (2022). I also co-developed several open-source tools for HPO methods and AutoML systems and have been a member of the team winning three AutoML competitions (2016, 2018, 2020). I am a junior head of the [Automl.org](automl.org) group, member of [COSEAL](https://www.coseal.net/) and [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/), and a faculty member of [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/). Furthermore, I co-organized the AutoML workshop series at ICML in [2019](https://sites.google.com/view/automl2019icml/), [2020](https://sites.google.com/view/automl2020/home) and [2021](https://sites.google.com/view/automl2021), served as a social chair (2022,2023), a program chair (2024) and a non-traditional content track chair (2025) for the [AutoML Conference](www.automl.cc) and am part of [Tübingen Women in Machine Learning](https://tuewiml.github.io/). 

**Research Interests.** I research methods for *automated machine learning (AutoML)*, with a focus on *AutoML 
Systems*, *Hyperparameter optimization*, and *Tabular Machine Learning*. Motivated by the goal provide easy access to state-of-the-art ML, I research how to improve and extend AutoML to leverage the full potential of ML for new applications in science. Specifically, I aim to understand how to best develop AutoML methods to automatically design, select and fit the best ML solution for a given task.
