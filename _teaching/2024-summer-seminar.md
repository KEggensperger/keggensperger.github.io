Have you heard about AutoML? Do you wonder what LLMs can do for AutoML and vice versa? Then this seminar is for you!

**TL;DR** AutoML aims to support ML users (and ML researchers) by 
automating parts of the ML workflow. In this seminar we will read recent
research papers in the field of AutoML with a focus on methods for and with LLMs 
and pre-trained models. For a detailed overview, see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08107).

How the seminar will look like?
---

We will meet each week (with a few exceptions). In the first few weeks, we will start with introductory lectures on automated machine learning, Bayesian optimization, neural architecture search and how to critically review and present research papers. After that, each week, we will have presentations, followed by discussions.

Other Important information
---

**Registration:** Please register on ILIAS. The number of participants is limited and the registration opens on March 29th, noon. 
There will be a waiting list (please unregister to let other people take your place). 
Please come to the first lecture even if you are still on the waiting list. If you're enrolled and don't show up, your spot will be freed for someone on the waiting list.

**Grading/Presentations:** Grades will be based on your presentation, slides, active participation and a short report. Further details will be discussed in the intro session.
