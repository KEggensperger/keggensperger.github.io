Have you heard about AutoML? Do you wonder what LLMs can do for AutoML and vice versa? Then this seminar is for you!

**TL;DR** AutoML aims to support ML users (and ML researchers) by 
automating parts of the ML workflow. In this seminar we will read recent
research papers in the field of AutoML with a focus on methods for and with LLMs 
and pre-trained models. For a detailed overview, see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08107).

Why should you attend this seminar?
---
Tabular data is everywhere any probably you have heard about it in your first machine learning lecture. 
But what is tabular data? And why is it challenging for machine learning? And how would you compare learning approaches on this modality? 

In this seminar, we will discuss these any many more questions. Additionally, besides learning about this topic and practicing your scientific communication skills, you will also 
  * learn about key contributions in the field of tabular machine learning
  * learn how to assess the experimental setup of empirical comparisons
  * be able to discuss recent research on large and pre-trained models for tabular data
  * gain experience in reading, understanding and presenting research papers 

Requirements
---
We strongly recommend that you know the foundations of machine learning and deep learning, including modern neural architectures and transformer models.
Ideally, you also have some experience in applying ML to get the most out of this seminar.

Topics
---
The seminar focuses on understanding the challenges of learning from tabular representations. We will discuss research 
papers trying to understand what makes tabular data a challenging data modality for some model classes and state-of-the-art
deep learning architectures build to excel on this data modality. 

Here is a *tentative* meeting schedule and a *tentative* paper list:

How the seminar will look like?
---

We will meet each week (with a few exceptions). In the first few weeks, we will start with introductory lectures on automated machine learning, Bayesian optimization, neural architecture search and how to critically review and present research papers. After that, each week, we will have presentations, followed by discussions.

Other Important information
---

**Registration:** Please register on ILIAS. The number of participants is limited and the registration opens on **TBA**. 
There will be a waiting list (please unregister to let other people take your place). 
Please come to the first lecture even if you are still on the waiting list. If you're enrolled and don't show up, your spot will be freed for someone on the waiting list.

**Grading/Presentations:** Grades will be based on your presentation, slides, active participation and a short report. Further details will be discussed in the intro session.
